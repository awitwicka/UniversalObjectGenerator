#Task Info:
You should create a universal generator, which will:

1. Create an object of a class
2. Fill its properties with random values
3. Create and fill also nested objects (for the purpose of this task you do not need to take care of the handling of problems with multiple nesting)

Note:
The generator should be independent of the class that it generates. 
It should be able to generate any class and not the only the one selected by the coder.

The generator should have also the possibility of setting ranges for the random properties:

1. The minimum value, maximum value for numeric data types
2. The minimum length, maximum length for strings
